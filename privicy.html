<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

Our Password Manager website is designed with privacy in mind. We do not intentionally
collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or physical

</ul>

<p>
We do not sell, trade, or rent users’ personal information to third parties.
</p>

<h2>3. Password Security</h2>

<p>
Your passwords are your responsibility. Our website does not transmit your saved
passwords to any external server. All password data remains within your own device.
</p>

<p>
However, you should be aware that no method of data storage is 100% secure.
We strongly recommend that you use strong passwords and keep your device secure.

<h2>5. Google AdSense</h2>

<p>
Our website uses Google AdSense, a service provided by Google Inc.,

<p>
Google uses cookies, including the DoubleClick cookie, to serve ads
based on users’ visits to this and other websites.

Google’s use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to users
based on their visit to our site and other sites on the internet.
